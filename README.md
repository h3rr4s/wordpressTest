Hi Dad!
This Repo is a test in order to play around with GitHub.
The use case is simple: We will use GitHub to clone WordPress-Themes to our local environment, make changes and upload them to production, using Github ;-).

I used the following unstructions in order to set up my local machine and configure GitHub:

I would suggest to make a very simple approval workflow, that always one of us needs to approve the changes in order to push them to prod. What do you think?

Let's have a short chat :D.

Cheers,
Your Son
